The GSA Parametric Search is a feature that uses the XML output of the GSA, in combination with javascript, to provide a means to visually filter results based upon meta data.

Here is the data flow for the GSA Parametric Search:

1. Query is submitted to GSA
2. Results are returned and XSLT is applied
3. AJAX query for standard clustered results is submitted to GSA
4. Standard clustered results are returned and displayed
5. AJAX query for parametric search is submitted to GSA
6. XML is returned, parsed, and parametric results are displayed


Functions:

- mTAddField(metaTagName, metaTagDelimiter)
  - metaTagName is the name of the meta tag to display.
  - metaTagDelimiter is a delimiter that will be used to split up values into multiple values.  An empty meta tag delimter indicates that the meta tag value is not to be split up.

- mTCombineField(combineFrom, combineTo)
  - combineFrom field is the name of the meta tag that you wish to take all the values from.
  - combineTo field is the name of the meta tag that you wish to place all the values in.

- mTLoad(id, mTURL, showNumbers)
  - the id is the div id in the xslt that the parametric results will be placed into.
  - mTURL is the complete set of URL parameters that have to be passed to the javascript, in order to retain all the appropriate search criteria.  If you are calling this from a GSA Frontend, then you will need to use the {$search_url} variable.
  - showNumbers is a flag which will enable or disable the display of the meta tag counts.  0 indicates do not show counts, while 1 indicates show counts.

- mTSort(metaTagName, sortBy)
  - set the sort type and order for a specific meta tag name.

- mTSetAllPlacement(allName, allLocation)
